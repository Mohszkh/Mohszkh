##  Hello There!
I'm a 15 year old with a passion for computer science.
## Languages learned
python and C

I want to master C before moving on to other low level languages, of particular interest to me is rust.
# Goals
-> contribute to an open source project (preferably written in C but could be any language) <br><br>
-> learn computer architecture along with assembly <br><br>
-> learn openGL <br><br>
-> learn the inner mechanisms behind operating systems ( basically study the linux kernel / read books about it ) <br><br>
-> learn networking
# Projects
Nothing to see here yet, lol.
